# Final Project: Practical Implementation and Analysis of the Tsodyks-Markram Model within an Integrate-and-Fire Neuronal Framework

#### I created this project in collaboration with my colleagues [Kristian Perri√π](https://github.com/kristianperriu), [Chibuzor J. Amadi](https://github.com/chibuzoramadi), as part of the final Brain Modelling exam assignment.

## Project Description

This final project for the "Brain Modelling" course involved the practical implementation and analysis of the Tsodyks-Markram synaptic model integrated with an Integrate-and-Fire neuron model. The project aimed to simulate the nuanced dynamics of synaptic transmission and plasticity, offering a deeper understanding of their contributions to neural communication.

### Objective
Implement and analyze the Tsodyks-Markram model within an Integrate-and-Fire neuronal framework to simulate synaptic transmission and plasticity dynamics.

### Tasks:
- **Implementation:** 
  - Developed the Tsodyks-Markram synaptic model using Python, capturing short-term plasticity mechanisms.
  - Integrated the model with an Integrate-and-Fire neuron model to simulate neuronal firing and membrane potential dynamics.
- **Simulation Framework:** 
  - Created a modular Python framework with separate modules for synaptic and neuronal models, simulation control, and execution.
  - Utilized the Euler method for numerical integration of differential equations.
- **Visualization and Analysis:**
  - Used NumPy for numerical computations and Plotly for graphical visualization of simulation outcomes.
  - Analyzed the dynamic behavior of synaptic variables and neuron membrane potential in response to synaptic inputs.

### Results:
- **Synaptic Dynamics:** 
  - Simulated synaptic variables (current, resource availability, and utilization factor) over time, demonstrating the transient nature of synaptic responses.
- **Neuronal Response:** 
  - Illustrated the Integrate-and-Fire neuron's membrane potential dynamics, showcasing classic neuronal excitability behaviors.

## Skills and Technologies Used:
- **Neural Modeling:** Tsodyks-Markram model, Integrate-and-Fire neuron model
- **Programming:** Python
